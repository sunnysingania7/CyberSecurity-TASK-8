# Task 8 : Working and Understanding VPN 

## Objective 
    The goal of the task is to explore how VPNs help protect user privacy and secure internet communication by masking IP addresses and encrypting data traffic.

## Tools Used 
    - ProtonVPN (Free version)
    - Windscribe VPN (Free version)
    - Website for IP verification : 
        [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) 

## Steps Performed 

1. **Check Original IP** 
    Visited the IP checker website before enabling any VPN to record the original IP address and location.
    *(See screenshot : `01_before_vpn.png`)* 

2. **Connect to Proton** 
    Launched ProtonVPN, connected to a free server in the Netherlands. Confirmed that IP and location changed using the same website.

3. **Connect to Windscribe VPN** 
    Disconnected ProtonVPN, opend Windscribe VPN, connected to a US server, and verified the new IP and location again.

## Observations 
- The VPNs successfully changed the visible IP address and location, demonstrating how they mask real identities online. 
- Both VPNs encrypted the internet traffic, which enhances security especially on public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks.
- There was a noticeable slowdown in browsing speed after connecting to the VPNs, which is expected due to encryption and server distance.

## Benefits of VPNs 
- Protects privacy by hiding real IP addresses. 
- Encrypts data preventing eacesdropping or spying. 
- Enables access to geo-blocked content. 

## Limitations of VPNs 
- VPN connection can reduce internet speed. 
- Free VPN services often restrict server choices and data usage. 
VPNs do not guarantee full annoymity; other tracking methods may still exist. 

## Conclusion 
This task provided hands-on experience with two popular free VPN services. It higlighted the importance of VPNs in safeguarding online privacy and the trade-offs such as speed reduction. VPNs remain a valuable tool for secure communication in today's digital world.
