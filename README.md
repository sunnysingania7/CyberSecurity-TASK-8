# Task 8 :Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions 

## Project Overview 

This project demonstrates the practical use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to enhance online privacy and secure communication.
Two free VPN clients - ProtonVPN and Windscribe - were tested to observe their effect on IP address masking and internet security.

## Folder Contents 

- `screenshot/`
    Contains step-by-step screenshots showing IP addresses before and after VPN connections. 

- `reports/`
    Detailed task report explaining the setup process, observations, benefits, and limitations of VPNs.

- `resources/`
    Basic notes about VPN concepts and technology for quick reference. 

## How the Task Was Done 

1. The original IP address was checked and recorded. 
2. ProtonVPN was connected, and its IP masking effect was verified. 
3. Windscribe VPN was then connected and similarly tested. 
4. Observations about performance and security were noted.
