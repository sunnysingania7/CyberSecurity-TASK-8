VPN Basics : 

- VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. 
- It encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server. 
- This hides your real IP address and geographic location. 
- Common protocols include OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IKEv2/IPSec. 
- VPNs improve security, especially on public Wi-Fi, by encrypting data. 
- Free VPNs may have data limits, fewer servers, and slower speeds. 
- VPNs enhance privacy but cannot guarantee complete anonymity. 
- Some websites or services may block VPN connections. 
Always choose a trusted VPN provider to protect privacy effectively.
